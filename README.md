# Otto-s-Gardening-Frenzy

Otto's Gardening Frenzy

Objective and Synopsis
    - Create a small game using procedurally generated obstacles and gameplay mechanics so that each playthrough of the game is unique (similar to Flappy Bird or Subway Surfers). Basically, I want to create a gardening game where Otto, a character from my past projects, has to maintain a garden by dodging obstacles and growing plants within a time limit.

Key Results / Milestones
    - Create a game where the player can move around the screen, collect seeds and water, and plant seeds.
    - Create code that allows for randomized, procedurally generated flying obstacles and plant pot placement.
    - Create code for a timer and level system.
    - Add music, animations, and visual effects that trigger with events written out in the code.

Schedule with Daily and then Bi-weekly deliverables
    - Ideally, one or two milestones are completed each week with progress added for each milestone every day or so.

Software Package or Packages likely to be used
    -  I'm planning to use Unity to create the game, as well as Clip Studio Paint and    
       Musescore for art and music assets.

Knowns and Unknowns
    -  I know how to use Unity to make 2D games, so I'm not worried about creating a game of this scale for this project. What I'm not too familiar with is creating randomized and procedurally generated obstacles; I've only made games with pre-programmed obstacles and levels, so making a game that determines so much procedurally will be a bit of a challenge.
